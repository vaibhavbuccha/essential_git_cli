- [x] There are 2 ways to destroy a brach one is using *-D* flag and another one is *-d* flag now the diffrence between both is that *-d*  will give an error if there any commit is pending but *-D* don't give any error it directly delete the branch.

```bash
git checkout -d  "branchname"
```

> merge branch
```bash
git merge <branchname>
```
- [x] git merge is user for merging wo branch and we also say that we use git merge for merge one repo to another for that we have to follow some steps first we have to move to our branch with we have to merge the another branch than we use the command.
